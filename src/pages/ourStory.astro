        <p class="text-coffee-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Since opening our doors in 2010, The Loft Café Bar has been a welcoming spot for locals, walkers, and visitors exploring Bingley.
          What began as a small family project has grown into a cosy, community-focused café known for homemade food, great coffee, and
          friendly service.
        </p>
        <p class="text-coffee-700 leading-relaxed">
          Our space sits just above the canal, on the main high street. It’s a place to slow down — whether you’re grabbing a quick drink,
          meeting friends for lunch, or stopping off during a walk along the Five Rise Locks.

      <p class="text-coffee-700 leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        We’re a small, family-run team who care about good food, good coffee, and genuine hospitality. Many of our regulars have been with
        us for years, and we love being part of Bingley’s everyday rhythm — from morning coffees to weekend treats.

          Whether you're here for breakfast, lunch, or a slice of cake, we want every visit to feel relaxed, comforting, and memorable.
